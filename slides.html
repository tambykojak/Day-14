      # Last Class

      * Red-Black Trees
      * Intro to Graphs

      # This Class

      * Graphs continued...

      ---

      # Review

      Graphs are a data structure that can be represented by
      * A <b>set</b> of Nodes. <i>Also called Vertices.</i>
      * A <b>set</b> of Edges or Arcs.

      ---

      # Review

      #### Directed vs Undirected
      * Directed graphs (also called Digraphs) are graphs that use ordered pairs how nodes are connected.
        * Up to two data points that represent Node A is connected to Node B and Node B is connected to Node A.
        * Represented using parenthesis: (A, B), (B, A)
        * (A, B) != (B, A)
      * Undirected graphs are graphs that use unordered pairs to represent how nodes are connected.
        * Only one data point that states Node A and Node B are connected.
        * Represented using curly braces: {A, B}
        * {A, B} = {B, A}

      ---

      # Review

      #### Weighted vs Unweighted
      * A weighted graph is a graph with edges that have a value assigned to each edge. This value typically represents the "difficulty" of traversing through that edge.
        * If you were representing a bunch of cities in a graph, you may consider the distance between each city the weight.
      * An unweighted graph is a graph where the edges/arcs all have the same weight, most of the time this is just a weight of 0.

      ---

      # "Weird" Edges

      * An edge can point to itself. This is called a <b>Self-loop</b>. Reference: Internet Crawlers

      * There can be multiple edges from that represent the same pair of nodes. This is called a <b>Multi Edge</b>. Reference: Flights from and to the same places but with different prices.

      ---

      ## Calculating the maximum number of edges.

      <i>Where n represents the number of verticies</i>

      * Directed Graphs: n(n - 1)
      * Undirected n(n - 1) / 2

      ---

      # Other Graph Classifications

      * <b>Dense vs. Sparse:</b> A graph is considered dense if the number of edges in the graph are close to the maximum number of edges. The opposite scenario is considered a sparse graph.
      * This classification is important because it'll change our approach to representing our graph in code.
      * Most real life graphs are sparse.

      ### Problems with Adjancency Matrices

      * You're taking up memory for all the edges that do AND don't exist.
      * This is okay if your graph is dense, but not okay if your graph is sparse.
      * This is also okay if you have a very small number of verticies.


      * For other cases, there is an in between solution called Adjancency Lists.

      class MyGraph:
          def __init__(self):
              self.graph = {
                  "A" : ["B", "C", "D", "E"],
                  "B" : ["A", "C", "E"],
                  "C" : ["A", "B"],
                  "D" : ["A", "E"],
                  "E" : ["A", "B"]
              }

      ```

      class MyGraph:
          def __init__(self):
              self.graph = {
                  "A" : ["B", "C", "D", "E"],
                  "B" : ["A", "C", "E"],
                  "C" : ["A", "B"],
                  "D" : ["A", "E"],
                  "E" : ["A", "B"]
              }

              self.graph = {
                  "A" : ["B", "C", "D", "E"],
                  "B" : ["A", "C", "E"],
                  "C" : ["A", "B"],
                  "D" : ["A", "E"],
                  "E" : ["A", "B"]
              }

      ```

      ---

      # In Summary

      * Never use two lists to represent verticies and edges.
      * When you have a dense graph or a "small" number of verticies, use adjanceny matrix.
      * When you have a sparse graph (most of the time), use adjancency lists.

      # Graph Traversals

      * Depth First
      * Breadth First

      ---

      # Depth First Traversal

      * Start at a node (passed as a start_point parameter)
      * Process the start node and mark it visited.
      * Add that node to stack S
      * Loop while the stack is not empty
        * peek at the top most item on the stack.
        * find the first unvisited neighbor of that node
        * Does an unvisted neighbor exist?
          * Yes
            * process that neighbor
            * mark that neighbor as visited and append the neighbor to the stack
          * No
            * pop the top most item off the stack.

      ---

      # Breadth First Traversal

      * Start at a node (passed as a param)
      * Process the start node and mark it visited.
      * Add the start node to Queue Q
      * Loop while the queue is not empty.
        * pop the first item off the queue
        * For each neighbor n
          * process neighbor n
          * mark neighbor n as visited
          * append neighbor n to our queue.
